# Project Rules

## Git Commits
**IMPORTANT:** Commits should only be made when explicitly requested by the user. Never make commits without user approval.

## Deployment
- Always verify environment variables are properly configured before deployment
- Test locally before pushing to production
- Ensure Google Tag Manager is working in both development and production environments
